    "\n",
    "- RK45:\n",
    "  - Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4). The error is controlled assuming accuracy of the fourth- order method, but steps are taken using the fifth-order accurate formula (local extrapolation is done). A quartic interpolation polynomial is used for the dense output. Can be applied in the complex domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RK23:\n",
    "  - Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 3(2). The error is controlled assuming accuracy of the second-order method, but steps are taken using the third-order accurate formula (local extrapolation is done). A cubic Hermite polynomial is used for the dense output. Can be applied in the complex domain.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- DOP853:\n",
    "  - Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8. Python implementation of the \"DOP853\" algorithm originally written in Fortran. A 7-th order interpolation polynomial accurate to 7-th order is used for the dense output. Can be applied in the complex domain.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Radau:\n",
    "  - Implicit Runge-Kutta method of the Radau IIA family of order 5. The error is controlled with a third-order accurate embedded formula. A cubic polynomial which satisfies the collocation conditions is used for the dense output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- BDF:\n",
    "  - Implicit multi-step variable-order (1 to 5) method based on a backward differentiation formula for the derivative approximation. A quasi-constant step scheme is used and accuracy is enhanced using the NDF modification. Can be applied in the complex domain.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- LSODA:\n",
    "  - Adams/BDF method with automatic stiffness detection and switching. This is a wrapper of the Fortran solver from ODEPACK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit Runge-Kutta methods ('RK23', 'RK45', 'DOP853') should be used for non-stiff problems and implicit methods ('Radau', 'BDF') for stiff problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among Runge-Kutta methods, 'DOP853' is recommended for solving with high precision (low values of `rtol` and `atol`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If not sure, first try to run 'RK45'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it makes unusually many iterations, diverges, or fails, your problem is likely to be stiff and you should use 'Radau' or 'BDF'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'LSODA' can also be a good universal choice, but it might be somewhat less convenient to work with as it wraps old Fortran code."
